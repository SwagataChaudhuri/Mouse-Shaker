# **Mouse Shaker**

Mouse shaker is a very simple and tiny Python script that keeps your system awake and prevents it from going into sleep mode or lock state by simulating mouse movements using code and thus providing the system an impression that it is active and not in an idle state.

This code proves helpful when developers plan to keep their machine active even when they are not active on the desk to prevent auto sleep during executing any long running process and don't have the necessary permissions to do via any registry / group policy update or doesn't have access to update the system's sleep / battery settings
